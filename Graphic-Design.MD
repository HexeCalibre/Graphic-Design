## ELEMENTS OF DESIGN

[Principles of Design](https://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf)

### Balance: 
Balance refers to the arrangement.

### Contrast: 
Contrast refers to the use of different elements (such as color, value, and texture) to create interest and emphasis.

### Emphasis: 
Emphasis refers to the focal point of a design, and can be created through the use of contrast, scale, and placement.

### Movement:  
is the path the viewer’s eye takes through the work of art, often to focal
areas. Such movement can be directed along lines, edges, shape, and color within the
work of art. 

### Unity: 
is the feeling of harmony between all parts of the work of art, which creates
a sense of completeness.

### Variety: 
Variety refers to the use of different elements in a design to create interest and visual tension.

## Design Process

### Research and conceptualization: 
This is the initial stage of the design process where the designer conducts research, defines the problem and develops concepts for the design solution.

### Sketching and prototyping: 
This stage involves creating rough sketches and mockups.

### Design development and refinement: 
This stage involves creating detailed designs, experimenting with different elements, and making revisions based on feedback. This stage is where the designer will finalize the layout, typography, color scheme, and other design elements.

### Finalization and production: 
This stage involves preparing the design files for final output, such as preparing the files for print or web, and ensuring that the design is technically sound for the intended medium. It also includes proofreading and final quality check before the final delivery.
